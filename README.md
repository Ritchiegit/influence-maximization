# Parallel algorithm
## Opportunity
We noticed that almost all of the computation time was dedicated to generating
a lot of reverse reachable sets. We saw this as an opportunity to parallelize
the generation of many RR sets at once. The following algorithm is the
pseudocode for serial node selection. 

```python
Initialize an RR set R
Initialize a node set S
Generate theta RR sets and insert into R
for j = 1 to k
    Identify the node v that covers the most RR sets in R
    Add v into S
    Remove R from all RR sets that are covered by v
end
return S
```

We can see that the generation of RR sets is a single line that can be
parallelized to be O(1) rather than O(theta).

## Algorithm
We represent our set of RR sets, R, as a (theta x n) matrix of booleans. We
launch a kernel on our GPU with theta threads and perform BFS and set a node to
true if it had been visited in the search. To set a node to true, we simply
index into R with R[Thread, Node] and set the value to true. Along with R, we
introduce a node histogram called H. The node histogram is a count of
appearances in any threads BFS. We will use this histogram the parallelize the
identification of "node v that covers the most RR sets in R". To initialize a
histogram, we allocate an array of size n in GPU memory with all 0s. In each GPU
thread, we atomically increment a count in our node histogram for each visited
node. At the end of our generation, we have two data structuresâ€”our matrix of
boolean R, and our list of integers H. For each iteration of k, we can perform a
max reduction and identify our node v in log(n) time. We can then add v into our
seed set. To update the node histogram, we launch another kernel that will
update our node histogram in parallel. This kernel launches with theta threads
and first discovers if v is in it's own set. If it is, it iterates through all
nodes in the RR set and decrements its frequency in the node histogram. We
iterate this k times and arrive at our final seed set S. The following block of
code is pseudocode for our parallel algorithm.

```python
Initialize our RR set matrix R
Initialize a node set S
Initialize our node histogram H
Parallel for generate theta RR sets and insert into R and update H # O(1)
for j = 1 to k
    Identify the node v with max reduction on H # O(logn)
    Add v in to S
    Parallel for over theta sets to update node histogram
end
return S
```
